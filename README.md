     2. User is asked to choose from the Menu list which Item it wants to update
     3. User is then asked to update the stocks_in.
     4. The app will tell the user that it has sucessfully updated the item and will show the date
     5. User is asked to update the stocks_used
     6. The app will tell the user that it has sucessfully updated the item and will show the date
     7. The app then calculates the amount left in the stocks and placed it in the inventory
     8. The app will prompt the user the quantity it needs to shop to restock the list for the next day. 
     9.The app will also promt the user if it wants to print the said list so they can use for shopping.
